# Description: This script extracts gene lists for the top enriched pathways using g:Profiler.
#              For each category in a pathway enrichment result dictionary, it retrieves genes
#              associated with the top N pathways by adjusted p-value.
# Input:
#   - Dictionary of pathway enrichment results (e.g., from a GSEA or g:Profiler run), where each value is a DataFrame
#     with columns including 'native', 'name', and 'FDR-adjusted'.
# Output:
#   - Dictionary mapping each selected pathway name to its associated gene set
